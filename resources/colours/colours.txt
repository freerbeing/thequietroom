Tips for Using These Palettes
Use the lightest color for main backgrounds.

Choose slightly darker tones for sections or cards.

Accent with 1–2 bolder shades (e.g., blues or greens) for buttons or highlights.

Pair with plenty of white space and subtle contrast for a truly soothing effect.

Test your palette in both themes to ensure text readability and visual comfort.

These color schemes are designed to promote serenity, inclusivity, and modern aesthetic—ideal for a meditation room setting.
