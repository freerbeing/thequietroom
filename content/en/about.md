My name is Rich (aka Ricardo)
TQR is my offering and my service


In ultrices, est at lobortis pretium, magna quam mollis neque, id viverra odio est sit amet lorem. Mauris efficitur nunc vel lectus porttitor, sit amet sodales quam eleifend. Duis et felis ut mauris dignissim efficitur. Aliquam non sem eros. Integer elit ante, bibendum id hendrerit vitae, vestibulum eget risus. Nunc efficitur nisl in iaculis vestibulum.

I'm just a 60 year-old bloke from the south of england
I'm not an enlightened/ascended master
But I have been walking the spiritual path with commitment and determination for all my life
I started Yoga nearly 40 years ago
It has grown like a snowball rolling down a hill, a gradual but accelerating acccumulation/growth
I have learned and experienced
4 year's teacher training, 830 hours contact with top-notch learned, experienced, dedicated and committed teachers

I practice every day
I live Yoga to the best of my ability

It has changed me
Supporting me through difficult times
And in better more stable times, directing lifting me feeding me filling me with light
There have been brief infinite instants of transcendence and transfiguration
Transcendence being the main goal of Yoga, leads to knowledge of our true Reality, our deepest Self
The goal is to stay there

TQR was until recently long-abandoned ruins, just half-walls, rubble, rubbish and mess
