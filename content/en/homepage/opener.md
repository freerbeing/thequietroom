*With practice, the mind stills, the Inner Light shines through ... and we are free.*

The Quiet Room offers an open, safe and free-to-use place to be in silence.\
Here everyone is welcome to come and practice peace and cultivate harmony.\
Or just to get some calm time.

The Quiet Room is dedicated:\
To contemplative practice.\
To the exploration of inner space.\
To the path towards our Inmost Reality.\
To Highest Truth.

May all beings be happy, peaceful and free from suffering.
